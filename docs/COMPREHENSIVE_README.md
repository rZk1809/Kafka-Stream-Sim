# Kafka Stream Simulator - Complete Guide

A comprehensive real-time stock market data streaming application built with Apache Kafka, Node.js, and React. This project demonstrates modern streaming architecture patterns and provides a complete example of building scalable, real-time data processing systems with advanced UI features and production-ready Kubernetes deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of several microservices that work together to simulate and visualize real-time stock market data:

- **Consumer Service**: Processes messages from Kafka and maintains data aggregations  
- **WebSocket Bridge**: Provides real-time data streaming to web clients
- **React UI**: Modern web interface with advanced features for visualizing streaming data
- **Kafka & Zookeeper**: Message streaming infrastructure

   # Producer
   cd producer && npm install && npm start

   # Consumer  
   cd consumer && npm install && npm start

   # WebSocket Bridge
   cd websocket-bridge && npm install && npm start

   # UI
   cd ui && npm install && npm start
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each service can be configured using environment variables:

**Producer Service**:
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Kafka broker addresses
- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: Topic name for stock data
- `PRODUCER_INTERVAL`: Data generation interval (ms)
- `STOCK_SYMBOLS`: Comma-separated list of stock symbols

**Consumer Service**:
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Kafka broker addresses  
- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: Topic name to consume from
- `CONSUMER_GROUP_ID`: Consumer group identifier

**WebSocket Bridge**:
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Kafka broker addresses
- `WEBSOCKET_PORT`: WebSocket server port
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Allowed CORS origins

### Docker Compose Configuration

Modify `docker-compose.yml` to customize:
- Resource limits
- Port mappings  
- Environment variables
- Volume mounts

## üö¢ Deployment
